# Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) - Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project uses **machine learning** techniques to detect **pneumonia** from **chest X-ray images**. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify chest X-ray images as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia** using image processing and deep learning methods.

The project is implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook (Colab)** and various popular libraries.
